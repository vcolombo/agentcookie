# agentcookie threat model

This document captures what agentcookie does and does not protect against. Read it before deploying anywhere you care about; the absence of a threat in this list is a statement of scope, not of safety.

## What agentcookie does

Continuously replicates Chrome session cookies from one macOS machine (the **source**, where the user logs in) to another (the **sink**, where AI agents run), with opt-out per-domain blocklists on both sides. The replication is one-way and authenticated end-to-end with a pairing-derived symmetric key. Past v0.11, the sink also seals its on-disk cookie copies (sidecar SQLite and per-CLI session files) under a sink-local master key whose Keychain ACL pins the agentcookie binary plus each registered adapter binary.

## Trust model

agentcookie trusts:

- The OS on both machines, including the kernel, the user account boundary, file mode 0600, and the Chrome process.
- macOS Keychain to store the Chrome Safe Storage password and the agentcookie master key. v0.12 onward: those Keychain items carry a per-binary `-T` ACL that names the Developer-ID-signed agentcookie sink binary plus each registered adapter binary. Any other user-uid process cannot read them silently.
- The Tailscale tailnet for transport-layer confidentiality and identity. agentcookie layers its own AES-256-GCM on top, but the tailnet's WireGuard channel is the transport.
- The user's local filesystem under `~/.config/agentcookie/`. Anyone with read access to that directory can read the paired keys file (still on-disk plaintext JSON in v0.12; planned to migrate to the Keychain in a follow-up).
- The Chrome stable channel's documented cookie storage behavior.

## What agentcookie protects against

- Plaintext cookies in transit. Every payload is AES-256-GCM-sealed with a per-pair key. The key never appears unencrypted on the wire.
- Plaintext cookies at rest on the sink (opt-in in v0.12). The sealing infrastructure is shipped: when the `agentcookie-master` Keychain item is present, the sink's sidecar SQLite is stored as sealed envelopes per value and each adapter session file's secret-bearing fields are sealed under the same key. The wizard install does NOT create the master key by default in v0.12 because the PP CLI consumer-side of sealing (U12) has not shipped in cli-printing-press yet. Pass `wizard set-keychain-access --enable-sealing` to opt in once the matching PP CLI release lands. Until then, the sidecar and adapter session files are plaintext on disk; finding S5 (plaintext sidecar) stays open in the default configuration.
- Plaintext access to Chrome's own cookie store on the sink. v0.12 replaces the v0.10 `-A` (any-app) Keychain ACL on the Chrome Safe Storage password with a `-T` per-binary list. Only the agentcookie sink and registered adapter binaries can decrypt Chrome's Cookies SQLite silently; everything else needs a user prompt.
- Online brute force of the pairing code. v0.12: 12 base32 characters (64 bits of entropy) and a per-IP token bucket capped at 5 attempts before a 429.
- MITM during pairing. X25519 + HKDF salted with the pairing code means an attacker who intercepts the channel without knowing the code derives a different key, and the next AEAD message fails its tag check.
- Replay of captured payloads across sink restarts. v0.12: the sequence tracker is persisted to `~/.agentcookie/sequence.json` and reloaded at sink boot.
- Source pushing blocklisted cookies. The sink reads its own `blocklist.yaml` and drops cookies whose `host_key` matches a blocked pattern, even if the source pushes them.
- Source pushing cookies with control characters or path-traversal in name / value / host_key. v0.12 adds RFC 6265 token-character validation on name, control-char rejection on value, and a label-boundary suffix check that fixes the v0.11 unanchored match (e.g., `xopentable.com` no longer matched `opentable.com`).
- Wrong-secret / unauthenticated requests. Both legacy `security.shared_secret` (now floored at 32 bytes) and paired keys gate every `/sync` call; AEAD tag mismatch returns 401.
- DoS via slow-loris and oversize bodies on the sink and pair listeners. v0.12 sets ReadHeaderTimeout (5s), ReadTimeout (60s), WriteTimeout (60s), IdleTimeout (120s), and an `http.MaxBytesReader`-enforced body cap (256 MB for `/sync`, 16 KB for `/pair`).
- Path traversal and inode exhaustion in unpacked LocalStorage / IndexedDB tarballs. v0.12 rejects payloads over 256 MB, tarballs with more than 100,000 entries, members whose path resolves outside the staging directory, and symlink / hardlink / device members.
- Listener bound to non-tailnet interfaces. v0.12 refuses to start the sink or pair listener on `0.0.0.0` and reads the Tailscale 100.x interface directly (or explicit loopback only when configured for local dev).
- Third-party data plane leakage. v0.12 has no hosted relay. Cookies never leave the user's tailnet.

## What agentcookie does not protect against

- Root or sudo on either machine. Anyone with privileged access can read raw cookies out of Chrome's SQLite + Keychain. agentcookie does not raise that bar.
- Compromise of Chrome itself. A malicious extension on the source or sink, a NaCl exploit in Chrome, or a malicious .dylib injected into Chrome can already read cookie plaintext. agentcookie does not change that.
- Compromise of the user's macOS account where the attacker can convince macOS that they ARE the agentcookie binary. The `-T` ACL pins the binary's Developer-ID-signed designated requirement, but a sufficiently sophisticated attacker with code-execution-as-user can re-sign their own binary with the same identity if they also stole the developer's signing identity. Out of scope; the bar is "stolen Developer ID Application certificate plus access to a private signing key".
- Tailscale account takeover. Pairing-derived keys live below the Tailscale identity layer, so an attacker on the tailnet still cannot read or sign sync payloads. But they could exhaust ports, run their own sink, or hold the tailnet open for traffic analysis. Out of scope.
- Device-fingerprint-bound sessions. Sites that bind a session to canvas fingerprint, accept-language, screen size, etc. will fail after replication. agentcookie does not (and likely cannot) sync fingerprint hints. Document affected sites in your blocklist comments and re-auth them in-browser on the sink.
- Device Bound Session Credentials (DBSC). Chrome's DBSC binds a session's refresh to a private key in the source Mac's Secure Enclave, which is non-exportable by design. For a site that has adopted DBSC, a replicated cookie works on the sink only until its short-lived window (minutes) lapses; the sink cannot sign the refresh challenge, so Chrome there logs the session out. agentcookie cannot defeat this and does not try. Scope of impact as of May 2026: DBSC is opt-in per site and the only broad adopter is Google's own account/Workspace cookies (GA on Chrome for Windows first, rolling out on macOS in the next release). Non-DBSC sites and the entire secrets bus (bearer tokens, API keys, OAuth refresh tokens) are unaffected. The source flags DBSC-suspect cookies in `agentcookie doctor` and ships them with a warning by default; `--skip-dbsc-suspect` drops them. For Google sessions, sign the sink's Chrome into the same account once instead of relying on copied cookies, and it establishes its own device-bound session locally.
- Coercion of the user. If someone makes the user run `agentcookie pair --as sink` against a hostile source, the cookies will flow as designed.
- Cookie value tampering by the source. The source is authoritative; if the source machine pushes cookies for a non-blocklisted domain, the sink writes them. There is no separate authorization layer per domain.
- Local processes while an `agent-sync` debug endpoint is open. `agent-sync` runs a dedicated Chrome with a Chrome DevTools Protocol port bound to `127.0.0.1` only. While it is running, **any process running as the same user can connect to that port** and read or drive the owned browser (including its injected cookies) -- which is exactly why Chrome 136 stopped honoring `--remote-debugging-port` on the default profile. Treat a running `agent-sync` as a same-user trust boundary: run it while you are driving agent browsers and stop it (Ctrl-C) when you are done. It never opens the port on a non-loopback interface, and it uses its own profile dir so the port never exposes your everyday Chrome's session. Device-bound (DBSC) cookies are not injected and cannot transfer regardless.

## Linux VPS sink + 1Password

Running the sink on a Linux VPS (see [runbook-linux-vps-sink.md](runbook-linux-vps-sink.md)) changes the trust model from the all-Mac default, in both directions. Be explicit about it before adopting.

- **No Keychain, no at-rest sealing.** Linux has no macOS Safe Storage, so the sink runs in `skip_chrome_sqlite` mode and the cookie sidecar is **plaintext**. The `agc1:` sealing path is unavailable. Mitigation: the install mounts `~/.agentcookie/` on **tmpfs**, so the plaintext cookie DB lives only in RAM and is gone on reboot (re-synced on the next push). It is never written to persistent disk. The cookie file is bind-mounted **read-only** into the Hermes container.
- **Secrets do not touch the disk.** With the 1Password surface enabled, the sink pushes secret values into a 1Password vault via `op` (in memory) instead of writing `secrets.env`, and Hermes reads them back on demand via its 1Password skill (`op read`/`op run`, also in memory). So unlike Hermes's Bitwarden secret-source path — which deliberately writes a plaintext value cache to `~/.hermes/cache/` — there is **no plaintext secret cache** anywhere on the VPS.
- **The persistent secrets on the box** are 1Password service-account tokens: a **read-scoped** `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` in the Hermes container's `~/.hermes/.env`, and a **write-scoped** token in the sink's `/etc/agentcookie/sink.env` (mode 0600). Both are vault-scoped, non-interactive, and **revocable/rotatable centrally** in the 1Password web app (where human access is 2FA-gated). A stolen read token exposes only the one vault; a stolen write token can overwrite that vault's items but cannot read other vaults. Scope each to the single `AgentCookie` vault.
- **The VPS is third-party hardware.** Anyone with root on the VPS, or the hosting provider, can read process memory (the in-RAM cookie sidecar, the tokens, Hermes's fetched secrets) and the service-account tokens at rest. tmpfs and in-memory secrets defend against *disk* capture (snapshots, backups, decommissioned drives), not against a live-root adversary. This is a real step down from the all-Mac posture; treat the VPS as semi-trusted, scope the tokens tightly, and keep the tailnet ACL narrow.
- **Transport is unchanged.** Tailscale on the VPS host gives the sink a 100.x bind address, so the AES-256-GCM-over-WireGuard channel and the pairing-derived per-peer key work exactly as on a Mac sink. No public listener, no TLS to manage. Keep a tailnet ACL scoping who can reach `:9999`.
- **Secret values never go on `op`'s argv.** The push pipes a JSON item template to `op` on stdin (the method 1Password documents for sensitive values), so secrets never appear in `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`. The systemd unit additionally sets `ProtectProc=invisible`/`ProcSubset=pid` as defense-in-depth. The probe step distinguishes a genuine "item not found" from auth/network errors and skips (rather than creates) on the ambiguous case, so a transient `op` failure cannot silently fork a duplicate item or mask the error.
- **Rotation is add/update-only (known limitation).** The 1Password push UPSERTS: it adds and overwrites fields/items, but does not delete a vault field when its key disappears from the bus, nor an item when a CLI is gone. A secret removed on the source therefore lingers in the vault until removed there. Reliable orphan deletion needs `op`'s field-delete syntax plus tracking agentcookie-owned vs built-in fields; it is deferred rather than risk mangling hand-edited items. Rotating a value in place (the common case) propagates correctly; *revoking* one means deleting it in the vault too (or rotating/revoking the underlying credential at its origin).

## Cryptographic specifics

- Cookie at rest in Chrome's own SQLite on each machine: Chrome's existing scheme (AES-128-CBC with per-machine Safe Storage key, PBKDF2-SHA1, salt `saltysalt`, 1003 iters, IV = 16 spaces, v10 prefix). agentcookie reads with the local key and re-encrypts with the destination's local key.
- Cookie at rest in the sidecar SQLite and adapter session files (v0.12 onward): AES-256-GCM under the 32-byte `agentcookie-master` Keychain key, on-disk shape `agc1:` + base64(12-byte nonce || ciphertext || 16-byte GCM tag).
- Pairing key derivation: X25519 ECDH then HKDF-SHA256, salt = pairing code (12 base32 chars uppercase as of v0.12; was 8 in v0.11), info = `agentcookie-pair-v1`, output = 32 bytes.
- Transport AEAD: AES-256-GCM. Pairing-derived 32-byte keys are used directly as the AES-256 key (v0.12: no redundant SHA-256 step). Legacy `security.shared_secret` values still pass through SHA-256 to produce a 32-byte key and must be at least 32 bytes themselves.
- Sequence and protocol version: int64 monotonic Sequence per source (v0.12: nanosecond granularity, persistent across sink restarts), int ProtocolVersion = 1 in every envelope. Bumping the version is a breaking change.

## What changes when

- v0.12 (this release) closes every Critical and High finding from the v0.11 threat survey except S5 (plaintext sidecar at rest), which stays open in the default install because turning sealing on requires the PP CLI consumer-side (U12) to ship in cli-printing-press first. Operators who only run agentcookie-controlled binaries on the sink can pass `wizard set-keychain-access --enable-sealing` to opt in; the on-disk sidecar and adapter session files become sealed and S5 closes for them.
- v0.13 (planned) will migrate the paired key keystore at `~/.config/agentcookie/keys/<peer>.json` into the macOS Keychain, closing the last on-disk plaintext credential.
- v0.14 or later may add Linux sink support, a Chrome extension on the sink, and one-to-many fan-out. Each of those reopens parts of this document; re-read before adopting. The Linux VPS sink + 1Password path (above) is the first of these — its trust model differs from the all-Mac default.
