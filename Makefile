# agentcookie Makefile
#
# Targets:
#   make            - build and sign bin/agentcookie (default; not notarized)
#   make build      - go build ./cmd/agentcookie -> bin/agentcookie
#   make install    - go install ./cmd/agentcookie, then sign $(GOBIN)/agentcookie
#   make sign       - sign bin/agentcookie with the Developer ID identity
#   make notarize   - submit bin/agentcookie to Apple's notary service
#                     (5-30 min; required before deploying to a Mac other
#                     than the one this build ran on)
#   make release    - build + sign + notarize in one shot (a fully-portable
#                     binary that launches on any Mac without prompts)
#   make verify     - print the designated requirement of bin/agentcookie
#   make test       - go test -race ./...
#   make vet        - go vet ./...
#   make clean      - remove bin/
#
# Build alone does not require an Apple Developer ID. Signing is split into
# `make sign` so contributors can `make build` and `make test` without a
# cert. CI release builds run `make` (build + sign) on a signing-enabled
# macOS runner.
#
# Override the signing identity by exporting AGENTCOOKIE_SIGN_IDENTITY. See
# docs/runbook-v0.12-codesign.md for how to install / renew the cert.
